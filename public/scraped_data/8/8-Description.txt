Highs and Low
Words and Music by
Aodhan King, Ben Tan
& Joel Houston

VERSE 1:
When it feels like the dark
Lingers longer than the night
When the shadows feel like giants
Are You chasing me down

VERSE 2:
Tell me where could I run
From Your light
Where could I hide
Hemmed within Your precious thoughts
There’s no hiding from Your love

CHORUS 1:
Highs and lows
Lord You’re with me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Even so
Lord Your mercy is an even flow
You’re too good to let me go

VERSE 3:
Should I dance on the heights
Or make my bed among the depths
Your mercy waits at every end
Like You planned it from the start

VERSE 4:
Should the dawn come with wings
Or find me far-side of the sea
There Your hand still fastens me
Ever closer to Your heart

CHORUS 2:
Highs and lows
Lord You’re with me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Even so
Lord Your mercy is an even flow
Should I rise or should I fall
You are faithful through it all
You’re too good to let me go

CHORUS 3:
Highs and lows
You surround me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Lord You’re with me through it all
Highs and lows
In the rhythms of Your grace I know
Should I rise or should I fall
You are faithful through it all
And You’re too good to let me go
